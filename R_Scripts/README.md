## Introduction
This is the legacy version of theclonalescent written by Drew Wham that is now implemented in python with the code written by Zach Fuller in collaboration with Drew Wham. The code that appears here is meant to serve as a resource and if you open the ".r" file you will find a number of different functions that will implement each of the many different funcions neccesary to run the full analyses found in the python version. Some significant theoretical developments were made while the approach was being ported from R to python so some of the methods I implemented for optomization and MCMC are significantly better and more computationaly efficient in the python version thanks to the work of Zach Fuller. We however have gotten very similar results using the two implimentations but if you intend to run a couple million simulations the python version will save you several months. Additionaly, other than the result plotting functions, this code is not maintained so if you wish to use the latest implimentation please refer to the python version.
