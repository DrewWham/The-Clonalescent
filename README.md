# The-Clonalescent
## user manual and guide
--------
## Introduction
These are a collection of Python scripts to perform simulations and estimate population-level parameters under a coalescent model of sexual and clonal reproduction. To visualize the results, R scripts are also included. Broadly, these tools are designed to detect and simulate sex events in the genealogy of clonal populations using the frequency spectrum of genotypes. Specific uses include:
* Inferring the effective rate of sex in populations
* Estimating the expected number of unique individuals
* Calculating the statistics *psi* and *D psi*
* Comparing the log-likelihoods of estimates of *beta* (from the perato distribution) and *psi* for a given genotype frequency spectrum
* Saving the posterior probability ditribution of *psi* using MCMC sampling
* Performing coalescent simulations to generate genotype frequency spectrums in a population given a set of parameters
## Dependencies
* Python 2.7.6
    * scipy
    * numpy
    * numdifftools
    * other required libraries should be included in most standard Python distributions. All dependencies can be installed using [pip][1]
## Usage
* run `python clonalescent.py -h` to view help and test that all dependencies are installed correctly 
* run `python clonalescent.py` from the directory it is located and use options `-i` to specify the name & location of the input file and `-o` to specify the name & location of the program output.
* for detailed usage, available analyses and instructions to visualize the output in R, please visit the wiki
