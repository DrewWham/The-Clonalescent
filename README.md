These are a collection of Python scripts to perform simulations and estimate population-level parameters under a coalescent model of sexual and clonal reproduction. To visualize the results, R scripts are also included. 
## Dependencies

    * scipy
    * numpy
    * numdifftools
    * other required libraries should be included in most standard Python distributions. All dependencies can be installed using [pip][1]
## Usage
* run `python clonalescent.py -h` to view help and test that all dependencies are installed correctly 
* run `python clonalescent.py` from the directory it is located and use options `-i` to specify the name & location of the input file and `-o` to specify the name & location of the program output.
* for detailed usage, available analyses and instructions to visualize the output in R, please visit the wiki
